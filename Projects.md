### My projects
Below is a a very brief overview of some projects I have worked on. The machine learning models and multi weighted colored graph (MWCG) project include detailed documentation. The flavor of the other projects is similar to that of the MWCG project.

<a href="https://github.com/enigmaticlogic/Projects/tree/master/ML_models">Machine Learning Models from Scratch:</a> Various ML algorithms coded from scratch in Python, including an artificial neural network which uses Pytorch for GPU acceleration. These scripts are runnable as is, and the relevant data set CSV's are included.

<a href="https://github.com/enigmaticlogic/Projects/tree/master/MWCG_Project">Multi Weighted Colored Graph Project:</a> Code for reproduction of models used and predictions made from another research paper which employs graph theory techniques and kernel methods with ML models (RF, GBT, CNN) to predict B-factors of proteins with competitive accuracy. This project involved using the parallel computing power of the HPCC at MSU, and includes several Python scripts meant to be run on the HPCC.

<a href="https://github.com/enigmaticlogic/Projects/tree/master/DG_Project">Differential Geometry Project:</a> Code for reproduction of models used and predictions made in a research paper which employs differential geometry techniques and ML algorithms to predict binding energy for protein ligand pairs with competitive accuracy. This project involved using the parallel computing power of the HPCC at MSU, and includes several Python scripts meant to be run on the HPCC.

<a href="https://github.com/enigmaticlogic/Projects/tree/master/FRI_projects">FRI Projects:</a> and <a href="https://github.com/enigmaticlogic/Projects/tree/master/Rig_Project">Rigidity Index Project:</a> Code for reproduction of models used and predictions made in various research papers which employ kernel methods and the notion of atomic fleibility to predict B-factors.
